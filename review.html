            <p>Over the past few years, CBN has consistently provided quality referrals. It has been a pleasure working with CBN for years. Over $150,000 has been added to our recurring engagements.  <cite>Cindy L </cite>
            </p>
            <p>All the accounting firms I was in contact with were not highly qualified to conduct work like CBN. It was this new firm that educated me about what was needed.  <cite>James D. </cite>
            </p>
         </section>

         <section>
            <p>The last few months have seen our firm earn over $30K in increased audit fees thanks to CBN. In order to provide accounting and tax services, we work together and stay in touch with potential clients.  <cite>Marriott firm, New York </cite>
            </p>
            <p>For the past two years, CBN and his group have helped me with a variety of tasks, including my yearly returns. They're incredibly informed and responsive. My questions are answered patiently, and they are eager to pick up the phone when necessary. Their recommendations are practical and appropriate for your level of sophistication. <cite>Dean A, from West Point Implement, Inc.</cite>
